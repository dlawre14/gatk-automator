Python GATK Autorun

This Python script uses the tk GUI to help automate a run of genomic analysis.

This software is designed to perform a run from pure reads (.fasta and .fastq files) through all of BWA and preprocessing using SAM and Picard tools. Finally this will allow you to run GATK as well as multiple realignments around indels for purifying SNP reads.

--------------------------------------------

Current Progress:

-August 8th, 2014
Initial upload of file, currently BWA functions should be working, but there is no guarantee that the produced SAM file is correct at this time

--------------------------------------------

This software is open source and free to use by anyone. If you wish to provide a modified version of this software please provide credit to Dylan Lawrence (dlawre14@slu.edu) for the original program.

Author Notes:
Currently this is contained in one very large file. Eventually each class will be delegated to its own file and the whole thing will get a .pyc conversion to make everything easier to use. Bear with during these early stages where it's still one massive, unwieldy, file.
